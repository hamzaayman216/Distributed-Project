# Distributed-Project
This project implements a 2D multiplayer Car Racing Game usingpygame. Players can control their cars and compete against each other. The game features real-time communication, score tracking, and enemy cars for added challenge.

This game utilizes various technologies and concepts, like Sockets Programming to establish communication between the game server and connected clients. Sockets allow for real-time data transmission over the network. Also Threading is employed to handle multiple client connections concurrently. Each client is assigned a separate thread, allowing for simultaneous gameplay and communication.</br>


we have two python files:

<ol>
  <li> The <b> server.py </b> file contains the server-side implementation of the game. It uses sockets to establish connections with multiple clients and coordinate the gameplay.</li> 
<li>The <b>client.py</b> file contains the client-side implementation of the game. It connects to the server and allows players to control their cars.</li>
  </ol>

# Requirements
Before running the game, ensure that you have the following software installed on your system:
<ul>
  <li>Python 3.x</li>
